   Project Mischief - 2D Sidescrolling Puzzle Platformer

About:
   Mischief is 2D platformer and level editor written in C++.  It utilizes the
   Allegro library, although the graphics systems mostly utilize OpenGL
   directly.

Style:
   Mischief adheres mostly to the Google Style Guide with a few modifications:

   1. Indentation is three spaces, not two.  Access modifier lines in class
      declarations are not indented at all (Google specifies one space).
      Multiline constructor initializer lists are indented six spaces:

      ReallyLongConstructorNameIsReallyLong()
            : some_member_variable_(NULL),
              other_member_variable_(true)
      {
         ...
      }

   2. Function names (including getters and setters) use camelCase, not
      PascalCase or underscored_lowercase.  Setter functions always begin with
      "set" and getter functions always begin with "get" (except for boolean
      getters, which may begin with "is").

   3. Compile-time constants and enum values use the form "kCONSTANT_NAME"
      instead of "kConstantName".

   4. Except for empty blocks and short inline functions defined in one line,
      block braces always appear alone on a separate line from control
      structures, function signatures, etc.
